  <p>There is a simple reason why Captain's Assistant is such a hot job right now. Put simply, what Captain's Assistants do is create the environment for a pleasant captain experience. If you proceed from the notion that every person who engages with the Captain would prefer a great experience, then you can say that everyone who engages with the Captain would prefer that the Captain's Assistant has done a great job. Starfleet of course knows this, so they hire Captain's Assistants to ensure their Captains provide great experiences. So, lots of Captains and lots of officers, crew members, civilians and enemies means lots of demand. LOTS of demand. ðŸ”¥</p>
