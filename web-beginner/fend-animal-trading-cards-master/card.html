			<p>I find myself intrigued by your subvocal oscillations,
				<br>A singular development of cat communications
				<br>That obviates your basic hedonistic predilection
				<br>For a rhythmic stroking of your fur to demonstrate affection.
</p><p>
				A tail is quite essential for your acrobatic talents;
				<br>You would not be so agile if you lacked its counterbalance.
				<br>And when not being utilized to aid in locomotion,
				<br>It often serves to illustrate the state of your emotion.
</p><p>
				O Spot, the complex levels of behavior you display
				<br>Connote a fairly well-developed cognitive array.
				<br>And though you are not sentient, Spot, and do not comprehend,
				<br>I nonetheless consider you a true and valued friend.
