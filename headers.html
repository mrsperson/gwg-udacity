  <h1>Picard: But this is not the time. Damn it, even I can see, the umbilical cord it virtually uncut. The child...the child depends on him.</h1>
  <h2>Data: Nobody can relieve me of that obligation. And I can not ignore it. I am...her father.</h2>
  <h3>Admiral "I am Starfleet": Then I regret to inform you that I order you to transport Lal abord my ship.</h3>
  <h4>Picard: Belay that order, Mr. Data. There are times, sir, when men of good conscience cannot blindly follow orders. You ackknowledge their sentience, but you ignore their personal liberties and freedoms. Order a man to hand his child over to the state? Not while I am his captain. </h4>
