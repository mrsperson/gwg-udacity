You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

I have learned a few new elements, <hr>, <a href>, <img>, mostly it has been filling in the gaps.

Most of it has been easy, just a matter of creating a new encyclopedia in my head.

Finding the right time, to concentrate and make the most of the opportunity. With three kids and a freelance career, days slip by in the blink of an eye.

I have a renewed focus this month and plan to use the most of it, in the coming weeks.
